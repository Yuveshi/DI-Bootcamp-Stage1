                    <h2 class="heading">About Nelson Mandela</h2>
                    <p>Nelson Mandela, an indomitable symbol of hope, resilience, and justice, transcended the
                        boundaries of his era to become a universally revered figure. Born in a small village in South
                        Africa, his life's journey was marked by unwavering dedication to the anti-apartheid struggle.
                        From a young age, Mandela confronted the harsh realities of apartheid, igniting a passion for
                        justice that would define his life's work.</p>

                    <p>His unyielding commitment led to 27 years of imprisonment, yet even in captivity, he remained a
                        beacon of hope for millions. Upon his release, Mandela's extraordinary leadership played a
                        pivotal role in negotiating the end of apartheid, ultimately resulting in his election as South
                        Africa's first black president. His legacy extends beyond politics, as he co-founded
                        organizations such as The Elders and the Nelson Mandela Foundation, dedicated to advancing
                        peace, human rights, and social justice.</p>

                    <p>
                        Beyond his public life, he was a devoted father and husband, leaving behind a profound and
                        enduring impact that continues to inspire people worldwide. Mandela's journey is a testament to
                        the enduring power of the human spirit to overcome adversity and champion the cause of justice
                        and equality.

                        <p class="card_text">"Conversations with Myself" is a personal archive that draws on letters,
                            notebooks, taped conversations, and prison diaries to take a thorough look at all aspects of
                            Mandela's life. Readers will find much here that is inspiring, including lines like: "[T]he
                            knowledge that in your day you did your duty and lived up to the expectations of your fellow
                            man is in itself a reward."</p>

                        <p class="card_text">In an effort to share traditional African folklore with as wide an audience
                            as possible, Mandela picked out 32 folk tales, old and new, drawn from various African
                            cultures, all rich in what Mandela calls "the gritty essence of Africa." In terms of a
                            contemporary African map, these stories are drawn from countries as distant as Morocco,
                            Nigeria, Kenya, and Swaziland. They also include various creation myths and tales.</p>
